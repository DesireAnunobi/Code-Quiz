Skills Boot Camp in Front-End Web Development - Module-6-challenge - Working with Web APIs

## Description
This Module 6 Challenge was created for the Front-End Web Developer boot camp students. The task was to create an application that you build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

What I learnt?
- To properly implement Javascript best practises
- Combining elements of HTML and CSS

I encountered some challenges on the way including:
- Styling webpage
- Trial and error with js code until corrected the output
